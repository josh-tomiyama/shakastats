    "section": "Logistic regression compared to other machine learning models",
    "text": "Logistic regression compared to other machine learning models\nThe important distinction between logistic regression and other machine learning models is that the statistical theory on the model parameters is well understood. For each of the \\(\\beta\\) parameters in our model, we know the statistical properties to allow inference through p-values or confidence intervals. Logistic regression is still a tool used today to understand, or infer, the relationship between a binary outcome and other data collected when statistical evidence is required to validate any findings.\nAlthough in most real-world scenarios the other machine learning models perform better in terms of predictiveness, logistic regression can sometimes still be a better model in terms of predictiveness. In my experience through classes and work projects, a logistic regression model is actually superior to the more sophisticated machine learning techniques of Gradient Boosted Trees and Random Forests under a few scenarios with respect to the AUC (area under the curve) performance metric.\nThe first scenario I’ve come across is when the sample size is relatively small. The machine learning techniques tend to work very well when there is more data to help effectively learn the functional relationship between the data you have and the target outcome. I would say this would be the situation when your sample size is in the magnitude of a few hundreds or less. After that point, other machine learning techniques perform at their expected capacity.\nThe second scenario where logistic regression can prove better than tree based methods is if one is willing to both select the covariates that strongly relate to the outcome of interest and also identify how each covariate functionally relates to the outcome. To expand on what I mean by “how each covariate functionally relates to the outcome”, some examples of functional relationships are the usual linear relationship, quadratic relationship, or sinusoidal relationship. In mathematical terms you can propose the following models:\n\\(Linear: \\log(\\frac{\\pi_i}{1 - \\pi_i}) = x_i\\beta\\)\n\\(Quadratic: \\log(\\frac{\\pi_i}{1 - \\pi_i}) = x_i\\beta_1 + x_i^2\\beta_2\\)\n\\(Sinusoidal: \\log(\\frac{\\pi_i}{1 - \\pi_i}) = sin(x_i)\\beta\\)\nChoosing a functional relationship alone produces infinite possibilities for one to sort through in addition to just choosing which covariates to include in one’s analysis. The strength of tree based approaches is that they learn these relationships with enough data, but of course the tree won’t be as accurate as if one were to explicitly identify that “true” relationship when training a logistic regression. However, identifying the “true” functional relationship between the outcome and covariates is rather impractical when one has many different covariates to consider at once. So once again, when the data becomes sufficiently large, it is more practical to use a Gradient Boosted Tree model or Random Forest model.\nThe advantages and shortfalls of logistic regression compared to other machine learning techniques naturally extend to any generalized linear model such as linear regression. To be clear, I am NOT saying that in these scenarios generalized linear models will ALWAYS surpass the newer machine learning models and algorithms, but rather that these scenarios ALLOW generalized linear models to shine just as well, if not better, than their other machine learning counterparts in terms of predictiveness."

Inspecting the average and quartiles of markup and cost between the different types, we don’t notice any difference in the distributions. This implies that type is associated with neither the cost nor markup, which is a best case scenario for a logistic regression analysis. The proportion of successful sales is different among the product types with clothes and shoe products selling at a higher rate than the accessories. This implies that there may be an association between type and product sales. Clearly, there is an imbalance in the distribution of type in the data set, but we have enough cases of each product type such that including type in the logistic regression model shouldn’t be a problem.\nThe second table summarizes markup and the cost variables by whether the product sold (the 1 group) or not (the 0 group). Comparing these two groups, we can clearly see that markup is lower in the groups that sold and indicates a negative association between sales and markup. The distribution of cost shifts about 100 dollars higher in the group that sold and thus suggests a positive association between cost and sales.\nFinally, in the scatter plot comparing cost and markup, we observe random spread of the points. There is no indication of a linear or other functional relationship between markup and cost, which is an ideal scenario for logistic regression."

All of the parameter estimates are statistically significant as 0 is not within the confidence intervals, so this is a convincing model. At this step, one would normally interpret these values as odds ratios, but that is not the goal of this analysis, so I will skip the interpretation.\nWhen building a logistic regression model, one usually has to consider a few different models to find the best fit to the data. Let’s consider three other logistic regression models. One without type in the model but all other variables in the model:\n\\[\n\\log(\\frac{\\pi_i}{1 - \\pi_i}) = \\beta_0 + x_{markup} * \\beta_{markup} +\nx_{cost} * \\beta_{cost}\n\\]\na second model with a quadratic term for markup and including all the other variables:\n\\[\n\\log(\\frac{\\pi_i}{1 - \\pi_i}) = \\beta_0 + x_{markup} * \\beta_{markup} + x_{markup}^2 * \\beta_{markup^2} +\nx_{cost} * \\beta_{cost} + x_{type=shoes} * \\beta_{type=shoes} + x_{type = clothes}*\\beta_{type = clothes}\n\\]\nand finally a simple model with just markup:\n\\[\n\\log(\\frac{\\pi_i}{1 - \\pi_i}) = \\beta_0 + x_{markup} * \\beta_{markup}\n\\]\nThere are many model selection criteria to choose from and which one to use depends on the goal of the analysis. In this application, the goal is estimation and inference, so I would personally advocate for the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). The BIC is a quantity that expresses how well the proposed model fits the data while also balancing how many parameters are in a model. More parameters in a model results in a better fit to the data but too many parameters results in overfitting. The problem with an overfit model is the lack of generalizability to new data. Please refer to the BIC() documentation to see the formula for its calculation. BIC favors having less parameters in a model as compared to it’s counterpart the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). Therefore, the BIC is sometimes the preferred model selection criterion when the goal is to identify what covariates to go into a model.\nLower values of BIC indicate a better statistical model for the data. A difference of at least 2 is the typical threshold to consider one model superior the other. For differences of less than 2 the models are about equivalent and the statistician must decide which model is superior.\n\nfit1 &lt;- glm(sold ~ 1 + markup + cost, \n           data = x_df,\n           family = binomial)\nfit2 &lt;- glm(sold ~ 1 + markup + I(markup^2) + cost + type, \n           data = x_df,\n           family = binomial)\nfit3 &lt;- glm(sold ~ markup, data = x_df, family = binomial)\n\ndf_model_selection &lt;- data.frame(model = c(\"True_model\", \"no_type\", \"quadratic_markup\", \"Simple_markup\"), \n                                 bic = c(BIC(fit), BIC(fit1), BIC(fit2), BIC(fit3))\n                                 ) \ndf_model_selection %&gt;%    \n  kable(digits = 2, caption = \"Smaller BIC indicates better model\") %&gt;%  \n  kable_styling()\n\n\n\nTable 3: Comparing Logistic Regression Models\n\n\n\n\nSmaller BIC indicates better model\n\n\nmodel\nbic\n\n\n\n\nTrue_model\n927.72\n\n\nno_type\n964.57\n\n\nquadratic_markup\n935.31\n\n\nSimple_markup\n1046.51\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpon inspecting the BIC values, the true model is unsurprisingly the lowest BIC and thus the best model. Disregarding our knowledge of the true data generating model, the model chosen at this step strongly translates the trends observed in the exploratory data analysis step, and thus highlights the importance of exploring the data before building models. The simple model with just markup is clearly the worst model with the highest BIC, so although the simple model would drastically simplify our optimal estimation of \\(\\pi_i\\) in the next step, the data indicates a more complex relationship between the outcome and covariates is more appropriate.\nAlthough we only inspect 4 models here, usually one would explore many more models and spend the bulk of their time trying to figure out the best model. More complex relationships like interactions and different functional transformations of continuous variables could be considered. Based on the exploratory analysis, this does not seem necessary in this analysis."

    "section": "Assessing Model Assumptions",
    "text": "Assessing Model Assumptions\nAssessing whether the model assumptions are violated is often overlooked when fitting a logistic regression model. The main ones to assess are linearity of covariates (assumption 2), independent sampling (assumption 3), and multicollinearity (assumption 4). Perfect separation (assumption 5) is normally a warning from R if that occurs.\nBased on the exploratory analysis earlier, multicollinearity is not likely not an issue in this data set. We know this for a fact because I generated the data independently. The exploratory analysis revealed that there wasn’t any clear relationship between pairs of the covariates, and all of the parameters in the model are statistically significant. These are both great signs that multicollinearity is not present. However, to formally check for multicollinearity, one can check the Variance Inflation Factors (VIFs) in the covariates. I’ll skip this step for now but one can read more on VIF theory here: https://online.stat.psu.edu/stat462/node/180/ and how to calculate it using the car package in R here: https://www.r-bloggers.com/2023/12/exploring-variance-inflation-factor-vif-in-r-a-practical-guide/.\nI will note though that if one adds higher order terms in the regression, for example\n\\[\n\\log(\\frac{\\pi_i}{1 - \\pi_i}) = \\beta_0 + x_{markup} * \\beta_{markup} + x_{markup}^2 * \\beta_{markup^2}\n\\] then instead of the VIF one will need to inspect the Generalized Variance Inflation Factor (GVIF).\nThe hardest assumption to verify is the linearity assumption. This only applies to continuous covariates which are markup and cost in this example. We can use the binnedplot function in the arm package to assess this. What this function does is bin or discretize the continuous variable into equally spaced segments. Within each segment, calculate the residual for the observations via:\n\\[\n  residual_i = y_i - \\hat \\pi_i\n\\] where \\(\\hat \\pi_i\\) is calculated from a proposed logistic regression model. We inspect the plot to make sure that the residuals are randomly scattered around the \\(y = 0\\) horizontal line, there is no pattern in the residuals, and that at most ~5% of the residuals are outside of the confidence interval lines.\nThese binned residuals plots assume a large sample size for the statistical properties to hold. Specifically if the sample size is large within each bin, then the expected value of these residuals is 0 with known standard errors due to the Lindeberg-Feller central limit theorem. My personal rule-of-thumb is at least 30 observations to be reasonably confident in the approximation, but the more the better. Unfortunately, the binned plots from the arm package don’t throw warnings when the bins have small sample size, so some caution is needed when interpretting these plots. In addition to large sample sizes, for values of \\(\\hat \\pi_i\\) close to 0 or 1, the statistical theory does not hold, so bins with mostly very low or very high predicted values of \\(\\hat \\pi_i\\) are not as informative.\n\n## example on how the binned residual plot is constructed\nrng &lt;- range(x_df$cost) # min, max of markup\n## break up range into 3 equal parts\nbreakpoints &lt;- seq(from = rng[1],\n                   to = rng[2],\n                   by = diff(rng/3))\nmidpoints &lt;- (breakpoints[-1] + breakpoints[-length(breakpoints)]) / 2\nres &lt;- x_df$sold - predict(fit, type = 'response')\nres_df &lt;- data.frame(res = res,\n           bp = cut(x_df$cost, breaks = breakpoints))\nres_ave &lt;- aggregate(res ~ bp,\n                     data = res_df,\n                     FUN = mean)\nplot(x = x_df$cost, y = res, \n     xlab = \"cost\",\n     ylab = \"Residuals: observed - predicted\",\n     main  = \"How a binned residual plot is constructed\",\n     pch = 16)\npoints(x = midpoints, y = res_ave$res, \n       pch = 16, cex = 1.2,\n       col = 'red')\nabline(v = breakpoints, col = 'red')\nlegend(\"topright\", \n       legend = c(\"observed_residual\",\n                  \"average_residual\"),\n       col = c('black', 'red'),\n       pch = 16)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s look at several binned residual plots to assess whether our proposed model is reasonable.\n\nres &lt;- residuals(fit, type = \"response\")\nbinnedplot(x = fitted(fit),\n           y = res, \n           nclass=NULL, \n           xlab=\"Expected Values\", \n           ylab=\"Average residual\", \n           main=\"Binned residual plot\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbinnedplot(x = x_df$markup,\n           y = res, \n           nclass=NULL, \n           xlab=\"Binned markup\", \n           ylab=\"Average residual\", \n           main=\"Binned residual plot of markup\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbinnedplot(x = x_df$cost,\n           y = res, \n           nclass=NULL, \n           xlab=\"Binned cost\", \n           ylab=\"Average residual\", \n           main=\"Binned residual plot of cost\")"

    "text": "Relationship between \\(x_{markup}\\) and \\(\\pi_i\\)\nNow that we have decided on a logistic regression model, let’s explore the relationship between markup and the probability of selling the product. The relationship between markup and the log-odds might be linear, but when we invert the problem to get the relationship between markup and the probability it is certainly non-linear. To produce this non-linear relationship, we can invert the log-odds back to the probability scale through the following formula:\n\\[\n\\pi_i = (1 + \\exp[-(\\beta_0 + x_{markup} * \\beta_{markup} +\nx_{cost} * \\beta_{cost} + x_{type=shoes} * \\beta_{type=shoes} + x_{type = clothes}*\\beta_{type = clothes})])^{-1}\n\\]\nWe are specifically interested in how markup relates to the probability of selling, but we have the other data variables in the formula. Before exploring how the probability of selling changes over a range of values for markup, it is pertinent to choose some representative values for cost and type. To start with, let’s set the cost level to be the observed average cost level and let type be the most common type in the data set to provide a curve.\n\n## there isn't a mode function in base R\ngetMode &lt;- function(x){\n  lx &lt;- levels(x)\n  ux &lt;- unique(lx)\n  factor(ux[which.max(tabulate(match(lx, ux)))], levels = lx)\n}\nrange_markup &lt;- seq(from = 0, to = 75, by = 1)\nmode_type &lt;- getMode(x_df$type)\nmean_cost &lt;- mean(x_df$cost)\nnew_x_df &lt;- data.frame(\"markup\" = range_markup,\n                       \"cost\" = mean_cost,\n                       \"type\" = mode_type)\n\npreds &lt;- predict(fit, newdata = new_x_df, se.fit = TRUE)\npreds_ci_upr &lt;- preds$fit + qnorm(0.975)*preds$se.fit\npreds_ci_lwr &lt;- preds$fit - qnorm(0.975)*preds$se.fit\nprobs_df &lt;- data.frame(pred_prob = inverse_logit(preds$fit),\n                       pred_prob_lwr = inverse_logit(preds_ci_lwr),\n                       pred_prob_upr = inverse_logit(preds_ci_upr),\n                       markup = range_markup)\n\ntrue_probs &lt;- model.matrix(~ markup + cost + type, data = new_x_df) %*% true_beta\nprobs_df$true_probs &lt;- inverse_logit(true_probs)\n\n\nggplot(probs_df) + \n  ## probability curve predicted from logistic regression in black\n  geom_line(aes(x = markup, y = pred_prob)) + \n  ## 95% wald CI in red\n  geom_line(aes(x = markup, y = pred_prob_upr), col = \"red\") + \n  geom_line(aes(x = markup, y = pred_prob_lwr), col = \"red\") + \n  ## probability curve using true values will be in blue\n  geom_line(aes(x = markup, y = true_probs), col = \"blue\") + \n  ggtitle(paste0(\"Probablity of Selling Product vs markup percentage\"),\n          subtitle = paste0(\"type = \", mode_type[1], \n                            \"  cost = \", \n                            round(mean_cost[1], digits = 2)\n                            )\n  ) + \n  labs(x = \"markup (%)\", y = \"Probability of Selling Product\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs expected, due to how well our estimates of the parameters are, the estimated probability curve in black is mostly overlapped by expected probabilities calculated from the true parameters in blue. As we can see from the graph above, the probability of selling decreases as markup increases. This isn’t surprising given that the true parameter for markup is -0.02.\nLet’s plot the differences between the true and predicted probabilities to really show how small the difference in magnitude is. We can see that the probabilities only differ at most by 0.02. Depending on the application context, this can be a meaningful difference or not, but for this application let’s assume that an underestimation of 0.02 is a reasonably close estimate.\n\nplot(x = probs_df$markup, \n     y = probs_df$true_probs - probs_df$pred_prob,\n     type = 'h',\n     ylab = \"True Prob - Pred Prob\",\n     xlab = \"markup\",\n     main = \"Difference between True and Predicted Probabilities\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Differences between predicted probability and true probability"

    "text": "Calculating the Optimal markup\nWe can propose the following function to express a balance between optimizing cost markup while increasing the probability of successfully selling the product:\n\\(f(x_{markup}) = (1 + \\frac{x_{markup}}{100})x_{cost} \\pi_i\\)\nThis function is derived from the idea of the expected total revenue generated by a new product. The new products total revenue is expressed as \\((1 + \\frac{x_{markup}}{100})*x_{cost}\\) and the expected value of a new observation \\(Y_i\\) is \\(\\pi_i\\) because \\(Y_i\\) is a Bernoulli random variable (see appendix for small derivation). Thus, the expected total revenue generated from this product is the multiplication of these two quantities.\nThe calculation of \\(\\pi_i\\) depends on \\(x_{markup}\\) and \\(x_{cost}\\).\n\nexpected_return &lt;- function(markup, cost, type, fit, log = FALSE){\n  new_data &lt;- data.frame(markup = markup,\n                         cost = cost,\n                         type = type)\n  # if(markup &lt; 0){\n  #   return(-Inf)\n  # }\n  \n  if(log){\n   ### doing optimization on the log scale is more stable, if markup &gt; 0\n    log(1 + markup/100) + log(cost) + \n      log(predict(fit, newdata = new_data, type = \"response\"))\n  }else{\n   (1 + markup/100)*cost * #total sale price\n    predict(fit, newdata = new_data, type = \"response\") #prob success \n  }\n}\n\noptimal_vals &lt;- optim(par = 50, \n      fn = expected_return, \n      method = \"BFGS\",\n      control = list(fnscale = -1), # do maximization not minimization\n      # These params don't change\n      cost = mean_cost[1], type = mode_type[1], fit = fit \n      )\n\nif(optimal_vals$convergence != 0){\n  stop(\"The numerical optimization did not converge\")\n}else{\n  new_data &lt;- data.frame(markup = optimal_vals$par,\n                         cost = mean_cost[1],\n                         type = mode_type[1])\n  optimal_prob_success &lt;- inverse_logit(predict(fit, new_data))\n  optimal_df &lt;- data.frame(optimal_markup = optimal_vals$par,\n                           expected_total_cost = optimal_vals$value,\n                           type = mode_type[1],\n                           cost = mean_cost[1],\n                           prob_success = optimal_prob_success)\n  kable(optimal_df, digits = 3, align = 'c') %&gt;%\n    kable_styling()\n}\n\n\n\n\noptimal_markup\nexpected_total_cost\ntype\ncost\nprob_success\n\n\n\n\n14.48\n2203.908\naccessories\n2011.027\n0.957\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom this analysis, we find that for an accessory product that costs of $2011.03 to produce, the optimal markup is about 14.48 percent. This results in a total revenue generated of $2203.91.\nAlthough our formula calculates an optimal markup of 14.48 percent, we need to keep in mind that the range of markup in the data set are values between 20 and 120 percent. Thus, a markup of 14.48 percent is outside the region covered by the data. I would suggest collecting more data in this range before widely adopting this decision rule.\nIn this section we only looked at one specific combination of covariates. Of course, we may want to consider cases with combinations of product costs and product types. To explore these different scenarios more easily, I’ve created a Rshiny dashboard that’ll be linked below when it’s done."
