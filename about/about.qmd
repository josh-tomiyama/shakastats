Aloha! My name is Joshua-Michael Tomiyama, but please call me Josh for short. I am a data scientist who specializes in building machine learning models on the admissions and enrollment of undergraduate students to improve higher education outcomes.

In addition to my work experience, I have an expansive range of academic research experience primarily in Bayesian statistics. Topics I've studied include:

-   spatio-temporal modeling of infectious diseases
-   approximate Bayesian algorithm development
-   Bayesian non-parametric models
-   model selection criteria for hierarchical models

My vision for this blog is to highlight interesting analyses I've encountered, to explain complex statistical methods and concepts, and to document my journey learning new technical skills.

If you have any interesting topics or further inquiries about me or this blog, please feel free to contact me at shakastats13\@gmail.com.

Mahalo for stopping by 🤙🏾
